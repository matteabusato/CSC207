1. Equitable Use：
Our project Crazy Bank offer several of abilities for user to use. The UI for the App is concise and easy to understand, good for the users to know what they want and get the information or functions they want to use. The user can use the mouse and keyboard to operate the App well for all functions in PC side. The data will save in local which keep the privacy, security of the user information.
2.	Flexibility in Use
User can use their own opinion to open on different PC side, with the software. After the log in UI, User can choose what kind of functions they want to use. The layout is symmetry, which is the same for left/right -handed people to use them. Each button in the main UI offers a range for user to click on, which means it give some accuracy error for user to do each action.
3.	Simple and Intuitive Use
The design is easy for user to understand, which each UI is simple and direct to show what each part is used for. The function User wanted is conform to the normal expectation. The sample “usage” name on button is necessary to know, otherwise, the graph in each part can offer more information for user to get what they want.
4.	Perceptible Information
In the main part, different button with name can offer the first “information”, after click into each part, the usage in each function can give a general concept that which part you are in. The information is easy to get for users with basic knowledge of Bank, which is the probable user of our App. And the information can be read by graph or table of words, which is fitting legibility. As the insufficient, we cannot really offer the barrier free ability for several kinds of people.
5.	Tolerance for Error
We offer the back button for each function which if user mis click the wrong button, they can just go back to Main to get what they want. The errors are thought dedicated by the developers, so whenever the errors we can image appear, there will be a WARNING or windows come out and show that the error will influence the normal operation for the whole App. As for those unintended activation that might appear, like the type of input, useless click etc., we will give the warning for them and give the correspond warning windows.
6.	Low Physical Effort
User for this App can use their mouse and keyboards to do nearly all the function we offered. It allows them to use less force on more action which we not expected. Each button offer correspond method, one-to-one action and transformation will be offered. We try to abandon repeat actions for each function, which user won’t act on the same operation on for different functions. The button and the transfer time is short, we try to decrease the physical effect for user when working on with our App.
7.	Size and Space for Approach and Use
We offer a centered UI with nearly 1/3 size of the whole screen, with the shape rectangle. It is clear and convenience for user to open other help Apps or do other recording when using our App. Users can also move the UI of each function, minimize, full screen, close or change the size of them by their opinions, which guarantee the size and space of App can be approached to the “size” user want.

 Who maybe not interested in:

While Crazy Bank is designed as a comprehensive financial instrument software, it may inadvertently be less accessible to certain populations due to barriers in technology access, financial literacy, or design inclusion. For example, individuals from low-income backgrounds may not have consistent access to devices or the Internet, hindering their ability to make the most of applications. Similarly, without additional support features such as tutorials or simplified navigation, seniors or limited computer skills may find the interface challenging. Language barriers can also pose challenges for non-native speakers if the application lacks multilingual support. Ethically, it is important to address these differences by incorporating features that promote accessibility, such as customizable interfaces, multilingual options, and compatibility with assistive technologies. From a multi-faceted point of view, some people, such as those who do not need to contact financial, banking and other Economic aspects of daily life, may not understand this software. This ensures that Crazy Bank complies with the principles of fairness and inclusion, minimizing the risk of excluding certain user groups.

## Project Purpose
CrazyBank is an all-in-one financial app that combines traditional banking services like account management, 
card handling, and transactions with additional features such as asset management, currency exchange, 
real estate purchases, loans, ATM location, and insurance policy management.

It is the perfect app for anyone seeking a seamless experience with multiple services.

Conveniently accessible in one app, CrazyBank eliminates the hassle of managing multiple accounts and 
dealing with different intermediaries, which often leads to complicated processes. With complete integration
of services, everything can be done seamlessly within the app, ensuring a smoother and more efficient experience.
